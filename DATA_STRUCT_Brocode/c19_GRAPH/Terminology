VERTEX      Individual data element of a graph is called as Vertex. 
            Vertex is also known as node.

EDGES
    Undirected Edge An undirected egde is a bidirectional edge. 
                    If there is undirected edge between vertices A and B 
                    then edge (A , B) is equal to edge (B , A).
    Directed Edge - A directed egde is a unidirectional edge. 
                    If there is directed edge between vertices A and B 
                    then edge (A , B) is not equal to edge (B , A).
    Weighted Edge - A weighted egde is a edge with value (cost) on it.


CATEGORIES
    Undirected Graph
                A graph with only undirected edges is said to be undirected graph.

    Directed Graph
            A graph with only directed edges is said to be directed graph.

    Mixed Graph
        A graph with both undirected and directed edges is said to be mixed graph.


End vertices or Endpoints

The two vertices joined by edge are called end vertices (or endpoints) of that edge.
